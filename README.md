# Webscraping-HW
This homework was pretty fun to do. I feel the real applications I can do for webscraping and how to more efficiently gather data. It was super cool seeing all the data raking in with the code that I did. I will say in part two generating the loop was the hardest part. I had to get help from a tutor in order get that part of the code working. I understood everything and was super rewarding to work on. I feel that I can understand all html and css structures easily. 

Concerns:
There are some prewritten analysis that's been left over. Not sure what to do with it ngl. Especially with some of the extra layout. Here is my version of the analyis:
- The coldest minimum temperature on Mars tends to occur during the third month, while the warmest month is usually the eighth, creating significant temperature variations on the red planet.
- In terms of atmospheric pressure, Mars typically experiences its lowest levels during the sixth month and highest levels in the ninth month.
- The duration from one peak to another on Mars lasts approximately 675 days, with the range varying between 1425 to 750 days. This timeframe suggests that a year on Mars is roughly equivalent to 675 Earth days, as verified by online sources.
